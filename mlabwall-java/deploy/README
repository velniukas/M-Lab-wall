This is a java port of the original processing code. It references the (local) processing and Most-Pixels-Ever (mpe) JAR's.
I have created functionality to allow the use of a single common .json config file to ease the management, deployability and readability of the configuration
The configuration file takes 3 parameters from the client:
1. ipaddress
2. display number (0..n)
3. Path to save the temp ini file to
